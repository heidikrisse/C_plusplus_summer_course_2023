# Assignment 7.1.2

(optional) Exercise 3.

We created a type for a 2D grid (Assignment 7.1.2), think about ways this grid could be generalised to arbitrary dimenions using variadics.  You can try this out if you want to, but don't get discouraged if you don't get it to work.  It's not the easiest thing to do.
